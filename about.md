Hey There! Welcome to my personal blog and thank you for taking the time to read it. I really appreciate your efforts.

I am a 21 year old Indian residing in Gopalpur, Odisha. I love to tinker with code and play games. I am also an avid photographer. You can visit my [primary website](https://asitkhanda.com) to see all my works.

I created this blog to express my thoughts and feelings which I think may not be accepted my society in general. So read my posts at your own risks. There may be some sensitive issues being touched upon.

Additionally, I would really love to receive feedback from all those of you who read my posts. I am almost active on all popular social media sites.
