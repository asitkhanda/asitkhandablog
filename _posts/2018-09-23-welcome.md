Hello everyone! After months of trial and error I was finally able to create my own [Jekyll]() blog. Its a static site generator which is very good for minimal blog posts. And so far, I have been loving it. Sure it requires a small learning curve but that is completely okay for me.

So, the real question is - **why another blog?**

Well, the answer is quite simple. In my [Medium](https://medium.com/@asitkhanda) blog I write about my experiences in Tech, Science, Photography & Culture. This space is more of a personal one where I will put out my thoughts about various things which may not seem a good read to some or even most. This also makes this blog quite sensitive one as I will also write about things that the society in general doesn't accept. Hence, my humble request to all of you that if you venture to read my posts please take a neutral stance and if you are the kind of person who easily gets hurt then I would recommend staying away from here. Trust me, its for your own good.

Anyways, with this I welcome you all to my nice little cozy place on the web. I hope that you all like it. And yeah, keep visiting.

:)
